## <a id="finalinsights"></a>Reading between the Data

After exploring how elections have evolved over the past two decades, and examining the demographic shifts shaping Copenhagen's population, we now bring these two perspectives together.

Elections do not happen in a vacuum - they reflect the people who vote, the neighborhoods they live in, and the conditions that shape their everyday lives. As mentioned we are neither political, demographic or economic experts we can only highlight what the data showed us, and encourage the reader to explore further.

In this final section, we offer insights that bridge voting behavior with the realities of life in Copenhagen - both at the city level and through a closer look at one particular district: T√•rnby.

<br>

### And then there was T√•rnby 
Let‚Äôs start with the politics. T√•rnby is Copenhagen‚Äôs most right-leaning district, just ahead of Frederiksberg (Slots & Falkoner). But the top party choices in each reveal a deeper divide: while both districts favor Socialdemokratiet and Venstre, Frederiksberg leans toward Radikale Venstre ‚Äî T√•rnby toward Dansk Folkeparti. Those last two couldn‚Äôt be more different (see more in the [ELECTIONS](../elections#elections)).

The same ‚Äúlooks similar, behaves differently‚Äù pattern shows up in the demographics. Income levels and welfare stats put T√•rnby on par with Frederiksberg. But the age and education story is a whole other thing.  
In every other district, 20‚Äì29-year-olds dominate, but not in T√•rnby - here they‚Äôre the smallest group. While other areas are dominated by residents with Master‚Äôs degrees, *T√•rnby* is the opposite: Vocational education is the most common, outnumbering Master‚Äôs degrees by a factor of four (see the visuals in the [SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS](../demographics#Sociodemographics) page).  
As mentioned in the Sociodemographics page, less education often links to conservative voting, while younger, highly educated voters tend to lean green or progressive. That‚Äôs a big clue to why T√•rnby stands out politically.

> üéµ *With parties shifting left and right*  
> üéµ *Do neighborhoods still match the hype?*  

But here‚Äôs the twist: T√•rnby is also shifting left like the rest of Copenhagen. Why?
Unlike other districts, this shift can‚Äôt be explained by a rising level of education, so maybe the answer lies in the parties.

This plot shows how T√•rnby‚Äôs three most popular parties have changed over time. We see a sharp decline in support for Venstre and Dansk Folkeparti, and a strong increase in votes for Socialdemokratiet. This shift largely explains T√•rnby‚Äôs overall move to the left. However, we cannot explain this shift through our demographic data, so perhaps it comes from the parties themselves.

        In 2018, Socialdemokratiet introduced a new immigration policy, ‚ÄúRetf√¶rdig og realistisk‚Äù (‚ÄúFair and Realistic‚Äù), marking a shift toward stricter immigration rules, similar to Dansk Folkeparti *(Source: [Kristeligt Dagblad](https://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/danmark/hvorfor-skiftede-s-udlaendingepolitik))*. This aligns with the data: as Socialdemokratiet adopted a more restrictive immigration policy, its support rose in T√•rnby while DF‚Äôs declined. New parties with stricter immigration politics emerged in 2019 and 2022, and internal struggles within DF may also have contributed to its drop.

        T√•rnby as a case study allowed us to connect all our demographic measures with the election votes. While some trends align and explain part of the story, the strong left shift over the two decades couldn't be explained through our data alone. By connecting the data with external political shifts, we found an answer. This highlights the complexity of the data and the many factors to account for.
