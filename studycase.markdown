## <a id="finalinsights"></a>Final Insights



After exploring how elections have evolved over the past two decades, and examining the demographic shifts shaping Copenhagen's population, we now bring these two perspectives together.

Elections do not happen in a vacuum — they reflect the people who vote, the neighborhoods they live in, and the conditions that shape their everyday lives. By combining election results with demographic and socioeconomic data, we can begin to uncover deeper patterns: Why do some districts consistently vote for certain parties? How might population age, income, or education be influencing political change?

In this final section, we offer insights that bridge voting behavior with the realities of life in Copenhagen — both at the city level and through a closer look at one particular district: Tårnby.



## Tårnby - Another kind of Constituency 

* Appears the same as Falkoner, Slots and Indre for income, age and support.
* Appears very different from all districts according to origin/diversity and educational level.

How come Tårnby is so similar with the other districts (different though for different variables) but the educational level seem to be different from the other districts. Tårnby also has a slightly different voting pattern than the other districts.



## Synthesis

What we have seen overall for all the districts.
