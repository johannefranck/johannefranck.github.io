          <p>Exploring the Demographics and Sociodemographic data to the People in Copenhagen</p>

    <h2 id="sociodemographics"><a id="Sociodemographics"></a>Sociodemographics</h2>

<p>Having explored how election results have evolved across the last six national elections, we now turn our attention to the people behind the votes. Shifts in political outcomes may reflect changes in party landscapes — with new parties emerging and others declining — but they may also reflect changes in the population itself.</p>

<p>In this section, we take a closer look at Copenhagen’s demographics to better understand these underlying shifts. Who lives in the city? How has that changed over time? And how might these trends relate to what we observe politically?</p>

<p>We begin by exploring how the total population has grown, followed by an examination of the age, origin, and educational background of residents. We then dive into key socioeconomic factors like income and support types, comparing patterns across districts and years. Finally, we consider how rising incomes appear to correlate with increasing housing sizes — offering a more nuanced view of life in Copenhagen over the past two decades.</p>

<h2 id="population-growth-over-time">Population Growth over Time</h2>

<p>The city of Copenhagen has seen continuous population growth over the last 20 years, driven by both natural increase and migration. This growth provides crucial context for understanding electoral changes: more people means more voters — and possibly a shifting voter base.</p>

<p><strong>Insert plot: Raw count of residents over time</strong></p>

<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 900px;">
        <iframe src="assets/age_stacked_line_plot.html" title="Interactive Bar Chart of Age Distribution Trends for Constituencies" style="display: block; margin: auto; border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 900px;" height="550">

        <strong>Figure X:</strong> OBS AGE! 
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The population increased steadily, especially between 2005 and 2020. This is likely influenced by both internal urbanization and international immigration. Such demographic shifts may explain part of the evolving political support observed in the Elections section.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-and-education">Diversity and Education</h2>

<p>Copenhagen’s population has changed notably over the past two decades, both in terms of background and educational level. Two important aspects of this development are the increasing share of residents with immigrant backgrounds and the rising number of highly educated citizens.</p>

<p><strong>Insert plot: Origin (immigrant status) over time or by share</strong></p>

<p><strong>Insert plot: Education level (e.g., primary, vocational, higher) by year</strong></p>

<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 900px;">
        <iframe src="assets/education_stacked_line_plot.html" title="Interactive Bar Chart of Education Distribution Trends for Constituencies" style="display: block; margin: auto; border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 900px;" height="550">
        </iframe>
        <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic;">
        <strong>Figure X:</strong> OBS AGE! 
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The proportion of immigrants and descendants of immigrants has grown steadily, especially in districts like Nørrebro and Bispebjerg.</p>

<p>In parallel, educational attainment has increased across the city. Inner districts in particular have a high share of university-educated residents. This aligns with broader urban trends where education level correlates with support for progressive parties, especially on issues such as climate change, equality, and education policy. Nørrebro has a very high share of highly educated residents while Tårnby on the other hand has very few higher educated residents. This might also be a result of the older residents in Tårnby compared to Nørrebro.</p>

<p>These developments help explain shifts in electoral patterns across Copenhagen and suggest an evolving voter base influenced by both cultural background and educational profile.</p>

<h2 id="socioeconomic-status-across-constituencies">Socioeconomic Status Across Constituencies</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>🎵 <em>Is Nørrebro all red and bold?</em><br />
🎵 <em>Does Frederiksberg stay rich and cold?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand economic well-being and its variation across the city, we begin by looking at the type of public support residents receive.</p>

<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 900px;">
  <img src="assets/support_districts.png" alt="Income support per district" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: auto;" />
  <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-size: 0.85em; color: #555;">
    <strong>Figure X:</strong> Support type distribution by district. The proportions of residents receiving retirement, unemployment, or employment support vary significantly across the city, often aligning with age structure and local economic conditions.  
    <br />
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Constituencies such as Tårnby, Falkoner and Slots have higher shares of people receiving retirement which again (just) aligns with the higher percentage of older residents. In contrast, inner-city districts like Nørrebro and Vesterbro are more dominated by unemployment supports although we saw earlier that there are more working-age professionals. The data shows clear differences in socioeconomic variation across Copenhagen, and may help explain the divergence in political preferences. between districts.</p>

<h2 id="income-development">Income Development</h2>

<p>Income is one of the clearest indicators of socioeconomic status. We first look at the overall development in average income across Copenhagen and then examine trends at the district level.</p>

<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 900px;">
        <iframe src="assets/income_all_cph.html" title="Interactive Bar Chart of Income for All of Copenhagen" style="display: block; margin: auto; border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 900px;" height="550">
        </iframe>
        <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic;">
        <strong>Figure X:</strong> Overall average income per year (Copenhagen-wide). Income levels in Copenhagen have risen significantly in the last 15 years. This overall increase reflects economic growth and the rising cost of living in a capital city.
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Looking at the districts individually, a more nuanced picture appears. Inner districts such as Indre By and Østerbro show the steepest income growth, while others like Tårnby and Brønshøj lag behind. This increasing disparity is important for understanding the evolving class-based dimensions of political alignment in the city.</p>

<!-- **Insert plot: Income trends per district over time** -->

<p>Closely tied to the income is the size of the living areas of the residents. As we saw in the notebook (source our notebook) the average housing size show a tendency of steadily increasing by the years. The trend is most pronounced in districts where income has also risen. This suggests a close relationship between rising affluence and residential expansion — possibly reflecting shifts in household structure, lifestyle, and urban planning.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Copenhagen’s demographic and socioeconomic landscape has transformed considerably over the past two decades. With a growing, increasingly diverse, and more educated population — combined with rising income and housing expansion — the city’s electorate is also changing. These demographic dynamics offer important context for understanding the evolving political landscape we explored in the election section.</p>

<p>How does all this tie together with the election data and is it even possible to say something about the trends and shifts of the political parties and their votes in Copenhagen? Click on the next tab <a href="../studycase#finalinsights">Final Insights</a> to know more!</p>
