## <a id="Sociodemographics"></a>Beyond the Ballot: The People Behind the Votes

> ðŸŽµ *Did demographics play a role?*  
> ðŸŽµ *Did new arrivals change the poll?*  

Having explored how election results have evolved across the last six national elections, we now turn our attention to the people behind the votes. Shifts in political outcomes may reflect changes in party landscapes â€” with new parties emerging and others declining â€” but they may also reflect changes in the population itself.

In this section, we take a closer look at Copenhagenâ€™s demographics to better understand these underlying shifts. The city of Copenhagen has seen continuous population adn wealth growth over the last 20 years, driven by both natural increase and migration (see [DATA](../data#dataset)). This growth provides crucial context for understanding electoral changes: more people means more voters â€” and possibly a shifting voter base.  
Where does the population increase stem from? Who lives in the different neighborhoods of Copenhagen? How has that changed over time? And how might these trends relate to what we observe politically?

We explore the age and educational background of residents in different neighborhoods, and then dive into key socioeconomic factors like income and support types.

### From Boomers to Zoomers: Who Lives Where?

First, we zoom in on age. What is the age distribution like in the different neighorhoods of Copenhagen? And has this changed over the two decades?  
To find out, take a look at the Figure below.

The most stricking thing one can notice from this plot is how Copenhagenâ€™s neighborhoods seem to differ a lot when it comes to age. Most districts are dominated by 20â€“39 year olds - except *TÃ¥rnby*, where older age groups are more prominent. In places like *NÃ¸rrebro* and *Vesterbro*, nearly 70% of the population is under 40.

Some areas, like *Bispebjerg*, are getting younger over time. Others, like *Vesterbro*, are seeing a shift toward older age groups. But in general, most districts stay surprisingly stable - pherhaps this suggest that people move to places that match their demographics?

These age patterns may help explain voting differences. Younger areas tend to vote more green (*Source: [DR 2022](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/folketingsvalg/de-unge-har-talt-intet-valgtema-slaar-klimaet)*) and less traditionally (*Source: [Altinget 2019](https://www.altinget.dk/artikel/farvel-til-magtpartierne-saadan-stemte-de-unge-til-valget)*). This lines up with what we see in places like *NÃ¸rrebro* and *Vesterbro*, where green, untraditional paties like Enhedslisten and Alternativet are very popular, and the people, generally younger.

### Districts and Degrees: A City of Academics?

Copenhagenâ€™s population has changed notably over the past two decades in terms of a rising number of highly educated citizens. This becomes evident, when investigating the visual below. However, there are also big district wide differences - can you spot them?


<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 900px;">
        <iframe src="assets/education_stacked_line_plot.html" 
                title="Interactive Bar Chart of Education Distribution Trends for Constituencies"
                style="display: block; margin: auto; border: none; width: 110%; max-width: 920px;" 
                height="550">
        </iframe>
        <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic;">
        <strong>Figure 5: Population distribution on highest achieved education level by district from 2004 to 2019</strong> Each color band shows an education level's share of the total population.

        </figcaption>
</figure>


This plot looks quite different from the age one â€” here, we see clear changes over time in every district.
In central areas like *Indre By*, *Ã˜sterbro*, and *NÃ¸rrebro*, Masterâ€™s degrees are now the most common education level, and over half the population holds a university degree. Outer districts like *BrÃ¸nshÃ¸j*, *Valby*, and *SundbyÃ¸ster* show a more mixed distribution, but still follow the same overall trend: more higher education, less vocational and primary education.

Then thereâ€™s *TÃ¥rnby*, which stands out. Its shift is much less pronounced â€” and fewer than 30% have higher education. Most of the population still hold vocational or primary school degrees, setting it apart from the rest of the city.

Then the question just remains - do social background affect how we vote? According to *[Berlingske](https://cvap.polsci.ku.dk/forskning/valgkamp/presse/Social_baggrund_afg_r_igen_partivalg_-_CVAP_i_Berlingske.pdf)*, it does. Lower education level tends to more often result in right wing votes *["De Kortuddannede trÃ¦kker mod blÃ¥ blok"](https://www.mm.dk/artikel/de-kortuddannede-traekker-mod-blaa-blok)*. Within the blocks, there are also differences. For example, *Radikale Venstre* is one of the most popular left-wing parties among the highest educated. *SF* and *Enhedslisten*'s voter base is stronger among the higher educated, whereas *Socialdemokratiet* is stronger among the lower education levels *(Source: [Finans.dk](https://finans.dk/politik/ECE7776519/S%C3%A5dan-stemmer-danskerne-efter-indkomst-og-uddannelse/))*.

These trends can also be seen from the data. Districts with higher education levels (like *Indre By* and *Ã˜sterbro*) tend to vote more for Radikale Venstre and other progressive parties.  
*TÃ¥rnby*, with lower education levels, leans more right-wing. But not all trends align perfectly â€” Frederiksberg (*Slots* and *Falkoner*) has high education levels but still votes more to the right (compared to other districts of Copenhagen), showing how nuanced district-level dynamics can be.

## Socioeconomic Divides: From Paychecks to Pensions

>ðŸŽµ *Is NÃ¸rrebro all red and bold?*\
>ðŸŽµ *Does Frederiksberg stay rich and cold?*  

This section delves into Copenhagenâ€™s constituencies, examining income support and income. We aim to explore whether economic disparities align with voting preferences and whether the persistent stereotypes about neighborhoods hold true.

Our data spans three reference years (2009, 2014, 2019), capturing a decade marked by financial crises, migration waves, and evolving policy priorities. This temporal scope allows us to observe how economic conditions have shifted over time. By analyzing these socioeconomic factors, we can explore how economic shifts may have influenced public opinion and political priorities across the city. Existing narratives suggest that income can significantly shape political preferences (*Source: [Kristeligt Dagblad](https://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/danmark/betyder-indkomsten-noget-stemmeafgivningen)*). Especially if there is a large income variation in the population, as higher income inequality has been found to both mobilize low-income voters and demobilize high-income voters, creating complex dynamics within electorates (*Source: [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0176268020301142)*). Through this analysis, we aim to discern whether the socioeconomic data in Copenhagenâ€™s constituencies reflects such patterns â€” and whether emerging trends reveal untold stories about the cityâ€™s evolving political and economic landscape.

### Income Support Patterns

The income support distribution provide a lens through which we can better understand the socioeconomic composition of Copenhagenâ€™s constituencies. By examining the distribution of various support types â€” such as unemployment benefits, state pensions, and social assistance â€” we can gain insight into the structural economic differences that demographic measures alone cannot show.

In the plot below, we present the average distribution of support types across three reference years (2009, 2014, 2019). Despite an initial expectation about very fluctuating ratios of support types over the years, the initial analysis revealed a relatively stable support composition within all districts. Therefore, to highlight differences between districts more clearly, the data is averaged over the years, steering the focus toward inter-district variability rather than temporal changes. This stability is observed even as approximately 10,000 residents moved to the respective districts within the time period as we saw in the explorative analysis and household numbers increased for all districts. This suggests that new residents tend to reflect existing socioeconomic patterns rather than alter them (*Source: [RUC Diversitet eller Ensretning](https://ruc.dk/diversitet-eller-ensretning-er-kobenhavn-stadig-alle-om-10-ar)*).

        <strong>Figure 6: Interactive layered barplot of the income support type distribution by district, averaged over three reference years (2009, 2014, 2019)</strong>. The plot highlights the share of residents receiving different types of public support, emphasizing differences between districts. Click the different support types to compare the districts further. The bars represent the share of the population (in percentages) within each district, including the "No Received Benefits" category which is included to normalize other support types and includes both children and those not receiving public support. This also indicates for all districts that the working force is the largest for all districts (approximately 60%).
        </figcaption>
</figure>

The interactive plot reveals distinct differences in income support distribution across Copenhagenâ€™s districts for the averaged period for the elections. The most notable difference between districts is the relative high share of residents receiving state pension in *TÃ¥rnby*, *Slots* and *Falkoner*. This aligns with the previously observed age distribution in these areas, where a higher proportion of older residents is concentrated. *TÃ¥rnby* also stands out with a relatively higher share of residents receiving early retirement benefits, further emphasizing its older demographic profile. In contrast, other areas seem to have a much other composition of residents as there are averagely less than 10% on the different pension supports in *NÃ¸rrebro*, *Vesterbro* and *Bispebjerg*. For these districts, unemployment benefits represent the highest relative share of support, suggesting a potentially younger and more economically vulnerable population. This pattern reinforces the narrative that people tend to move into areas with similar socioeconomic profiles, thereby maintaining existing support compositions. A noteworthy exclusion in the dataset is the SU (student support), which is not included in the current visualizations as it is not present in the data. Given the concentration of student populations in districts such as *NÃ¸rrebro* and *Vesterbro*, this omission may partially obscure the socioeconomic dynamics in these areas. 

Social assistance is perhaps the most debated type of income support and often leveraged by politicians, as public opinions on the topic are highly polarized (*Source: [Berlingske](https://www.berlingske.dk/politik/et-besoeg-hos-en-kontanthjaelpsmodtager-har-gjort-stort-indtryk-paa-las)*). From the plot, we can observe differences in the share of residents receiving social assistance across districts. *Bispebjerg* has the highest average share of residents receiving social assistance. However, further examination of support types over the years reveals that this is primarily driven by a spike in 2014, where approximately 8% of residents received social assistance. By 2019, this figure had reduced to around 5% - still the highest among the districts. All districts, however, experienced a noticeable increase in social assistance in 2014, likely due to the lingering effects of the financial crisis, which led to increased unemployment. Additionally, governmental initiatives, such as the introduction of arbejdsmarkedsydelse (labour market allowance), aimed to reduce the stateâ€™s financial burden by encouraging employment and limiting the years during which citizens were eligible for benefits. (*Sources: [Avisen.dk and Ritzau](https://www.avisen.dk/staten-faar-lavere-regning-for-flere-paa-kontanthjae_322727.aspx)* and *[Danmarks Statistik](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/nyheder-analyser-publ/nyt/NytHtml?cid=19305)*)

### Wealth Gaps and Rising Incomes

After examining income support, we now turn to household income, a critical measure of socioeconomic status that can reveal significant disparities across Copenhagenâ€™s districts. In the exploratory analysis, we observed a notable increase in household income across all constituencies over time, suggesting a general economic uplift for all of Copenhagen from 2009 to 2019. However, while income levels have risen, the distribution is not uniform across districts. The interactive plot below highlights these disparities, showing the proportion of households in various income brackets from 2009 to 2019. Overall, the share of households earning 500,000â€“749,999 DKK and over 750,000 DKK has increased across all districts, reflecting broader economic growth and a changing city.


<figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 900px;">
        <iframe src="assets/income_districts_stacked_bar.html" 
                title="Interactive Bar Chart of Income for All of Copenhagen"
                style="display: block; margin: auto; border: none; width: 110%; max-width: 920px;" 
                height="520">
        </iframe>
        <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic;">
        <strong>Figure 7: Interactive plot of household income distribution in Copenhagen over three reference years (2009, 2014, 2019)</strong>. The plot shows how income levels have shifted across districts, with a noticeable increase in higher income intervals over time. Click the toggle to view other districts and observe differences in income distribution and hover the distributions to see exact share of income interval.
        </figcaption>
</figure>


*TÃ¥rnby*, *Falkoner*, and *Indre By* stand out as the wealthiest districts, with 35% or more of households in each district earning above 750,000 DKK annually by 2019. In contrast, *NÃ¸rrebro* and *Bispebjerg* maintain a more diverse income distribution, with a broader spectrum of income brackets. This broader distribution aligns with the income support patterns observed earlier, where these districts had higher shares of unemployment benefits. 
A common trend across all districts is the overall rise in income levels. The number of households earning over 750,000 DKK annually has approximately doubled from 2009 to 2019 in every district. The most pronounced increase occurs in *Bispebjerg* and *NÃ¸rrebro*, where the share of households earning over 500,000 DKK rose from 18.7% to 35.9% and 20% to 40%, respectively. In *TÃ¥rnby*, the share of households earning above 500,000 DKK annually increased from 43% to 55%, further solidifying its profile as a higher-income district. However, this increase is less dramatic compared to the steeper rises in *NÃ¸rrebro* and *Bispebjerg*. 

Another notable trend is the sharp decline in households earning 100,000â€“149,999 DKK annually, a pattern consistent across all districts. This decline suggests a broader economic uplift, but it also raises questions about the affordability of living in Copenhagen for lower-income residents (*Source: [RUC Diversitet eller Ensretning](https://ruc.dk/diversitet-eller-ensretning-er-kobenhavn-stadig-alle-om-10-ar)*). As these lower-income brackets steadily diminish, the question arises: Will the cityâ€™s diversity persist if lower-income households are increasingly priced out? The observed trends suggest that Copenhagen is becoming increasingly affluent across all districts, with rising income levels and a growing share of high-income households. However, since the data does not track individuals over time, it is unclear whether these trends are driven by current residents earning more or by the arrival of wealthier newcomers. (*Source: [AE RÃ¥det](https://www.ae.dk/files/dokumenter/analyse/ae_velstillede-boernefamilier-indtager-koebenhavn_0.pdf)*)

While rising incomes may signal economic growth, it could also indicate growing economic polarization. This could particularly affect districts with more uniform income distributions, such as *NÃ¸rrebro* and *Bispebjerg*, where economic diversity may foster a another spectrum of political beliefs and values as we saw in the party vote shares and winning parties in the election analysis. 
As the city becomes more expensive to live in, some residents may also be priced out, leading to a wealthier overall population which needs to be noticed and planned for in the future (*Source: [Via Ritzau](https://via.ritzau.dk/pressemeddelelse/13726689/ny-undersogelse-derfor-flytter-tusindvis-hvert-ar-til-og-fra-kobenhavn?lang=da)*). 
However, this polarization trend may also contribute to higher voter turnout in some areas. For instance, *Falkoner* â€” with 56.6% of households earning more than 500,000 DKK annually â€” also has the highest voter turnout (Figure 1, DATA). This could be because income disparity within the district mobilizes those earning less to make their voices heard, as suggested by research on income inequality and voter mobilization (*Source: [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0176268020301142)*). 
On the other hand, *TÃ¥rnby* presents a different pattern. Despite having a similar income distribution to *Falkoner*, with more than a third of households earning above 750,000 DKK annually, it does not exhibit the same high voter turnout. This could be linked to the political dynamics observed in the election analysis (Figure 3, ELECTIONS), where *Socialdemokratiet*, *Venstre*, and, up until 2019, *Dansk Folkeparti* have maintained a strong presence in *TÃ¥rnby*, contrasting with the more balanced political landscape in *Falkoner*. 

Overall, while the income distributions across districts are evolving, with rising affluence and a shrinking share of lower-income households, the relationship between income and political preferences remains complex. Similar income profiles do not necessarily translate into similar voting patterns, as demonstrated by the contrasting political landscapes in districts like *Falkoner* and *TÃ¥rnby*, where comparable income levels are associated with distinctly different electoral outcomes.
