## <a id="beyond"></a>Reading between the Data

After exploring how elections have evolved over the past two decades, and examining the demographic shifts shaping Copenhagen's population, we now bring these two perspectives together.

Elections do not happen in a vacuum - they reflect the people who vote, the neighborhoods they live in, and the conditions that shape their everyday lives. As mentioned we are neither political, demographic or economic experts we can only highlight what the data showed us, and encourage the reader to explore further.

In this final section, we offer insights that bridge voting behavior with the realities of life in Copenhagen - both at the city level and through a closer look at one particular district: *Tårnby*.

<br>

### And then there was Tårnby 
Let’s start with the politics. *Tårnby* is Copenhagen’s most right-leaning district, just ahead of Frederiksberg (*Slots* & *Falkoner*). But the top party choices in each reveal a deeper divide: while both districts favor *Socialdemokratiet* and *Venstre*, Frederiksberg leans toward *Radikale Venstre* — *Tårnby* toward *Dansk Folkeparti*. Those last two could not be more different (see more in the [ELECTIONS](../elections#elections)).

The same “looks similar, behaves differently” pattern shows up in the demographics. Income levels and welfare stats put *Tårnby* on par with Frederiksberg. But the age and education story is a whole other thing.  
In every other district, 20–29-year-olds dominate, but not in *Tårnby* - here they are the smallest group. While other areas are dominated by residents with Master’s degrees, *Tårnby* is the opposite: Vocational education is the most common, outnumbering Master’s degrees by a factor of four (see the visuals in the [SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS](../demographics#Sociodemographics) page).  
As mentioned in the Sociodemographics page, less education often links to conservative voting, while younger, highly educated voters tend to lean green or progressive. That is a big clue to why *Tårnby* stands out politically.

> 🎵 *Do neighborhoods still match the hype?*  

But here’s the twist: *Tårnby* is also shifting left like the rest of Copenhagen. Why?
Unlike other districts, this shift can’t be explained by a rising level of education, so maybe the answer lies in the parties.

This plot shows how *Tårnby*'s three most popular parties have changed over time. We see a sharp decline in support for *Venstre* and *Dansk Folkeparti*, and a strong increase in votes for *Socialdemokratiet*. This shift largely explains *Tårnby*'s overall move to the left. However, we cannot explain this shift through our demographic data, so perhaps it comes from the parties themselves.

        In 2018, <em>Socialdemokratiet</em> introduced a new immigration policy, “Retfærdig og realistisk” (“Fair and Realistic”), marking a shift toward stricter immigration rules, similar to <em>Dansk Folkeparti</em>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source:

        </span>
        This aligns with the data: as <em>Socialdemokratiet</em> adopted a more restrictive immigration policy, its support rose in <em>Tårnby</em> while <em>Dansk Folkeparti</em>’s declined. New parties with stricter immigration politics emerged in 2019 and 2022, and internal struggles within <em>Dansk Folkeparti</em> may also have contributed to its drop.

    <p>
        <em>Tårnby</em> as a case study allowed us to connect all our demographic measures with the election votes. While some trends align and explain part of the story, the strong left shift over the two decades couldn't be explained through our data alone. By connecting the data with external political shifts, we found an answer. This highlights the complexity of the data and the many factors to account for.

### Where to Next? More to Explore

The district voting patterns tend to cluster, with distinct differences emerging within these groupings based on similar voting behavior and trends. From 2005 to 2022, districts in Copenhagen generally exhibited a shift towards more left-leaning voting behavior.

From a sociodemographic perspective, the districts display distinct characteristics. Districts with higher concentrations of young adults and residents holding Master's degrees tend to support progressive parties. More young adults are staying in the city over time, while income levels rise and educational attainment becomes increasingly academic across most districts. However, income and education do not consistently align across districts. These sociodemographic distinctions may contribute to increasing polarization, both between and within districts, potentially further impacting electoral outcomes.

The relationship between demographics and political behavior is complex. While demographic factors offer some insights, political shifts within parties and broader societal changes also play significant roles. This analysis only scratches the surface, exploring just a fraction of the variables potentially influencing electoral outcomes.

Now, we invite you, dear reader: What sets *Nørrebro* politically apart, with its higher share of *Enhedslisten* votes compared to other inner-city districts? Is the increasingly younger population in *Valby* reflected in its voting patterns? There are more trends to uncover — what will you discover?
