## <a id="elections"></a>Setting the Stage: What the Ballot Boxes Reveal

What kind of city is Copenhagen when it comes to politics? Is it dominated by a single ideology, or is it a political landscape shaped by shifting loyalties and local differences?

To find out, we dive into two decades of election data, tracking how the city’s districts have voted from 2005 to 2022. Our journey starts with a high-level overview of the political scene between left-wing and right-wing blocs — then narrows down to examine the rise and fall of individual parties.

From climate debates to coalition politics, from stable party loyalties to shifting district dynamics, this exploration reveals a city in constant political transformation — shaped by issues, neighborhoods, and time.

## How Copenhagen Votes: Mapping the Left and Right Over Time

> 🎵 *In Copenhagen’s twelve domains*\
> 🎵 *Did left-wing rise? Did right-wing wane?*


To understand how Copenhagen votes, we first need to ask a big question: What kind of political city is it? Is the Danish capital a stronghold of the left, a quiet supporter of the right, or a patchwork of political preferences that vary by neighborhood?

To find out, we take a closer look at the distribution of votes for the left-wing and right-wing blocs across constituencies in Copenhagen over the last six elections.

Before we can analyze voting patterns, we need to draw the political boundaries. The table below shows how we have grouped Danish parties into left- and right-wing blocs.

Most Danish parties have clear ideologies and are easy to group, while some define themselves as centrist and are more difficult to place. One example is *Centrum Demokraterne*, a centrist party that broke away from *Socialdemokratiet* in 1973. While they collaborated with both political blocs during their time in Parliament, we have chosen to place them in the right-wing category. This decision reflects their ideological origins and the general rightward tilt of their policies (*Source: [danmarkshistorien.dk](https://danmarkshistorien.lex.dk/Centrum-Demokraterne_1973-2008)*). Another tricky case is *Moderaterne*, a relatively new party founded in 2021 by former Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Although their first time in government (in 2022) involved a centrist coalition, we have chosen to classify them as right-leaning, based on their political stance and liberal-centrist identity, which places them closer to the center-right in Denmark’s political spectrum (*Source: [moderaterne.dk](https://moderaterne.dk/moderaterne-mener/)*).

With these classifications in place, we can now explore how each of Copenhagen’s neighborhoods aligns politically — and whether the city speaks with one voice or many. To do so, we visualize the left-wing vote shares across the city’s twelve constituencies in the map below.

    <strong>Map 2: Left-wing vote shares across Copenhagen constituencies from 2005 to 2022. </strong> The map shows the percentage of votes received by left-wing parties in each constituency, with colors ranging from blue (indicating stronger right-wing support) to red (indicating stronger left-wing support). The redder the district, the stronger its tilt to the left; the bluer, the more it leaned to the right. The map is interactive — hover over a constituency to see its exact left-wing vote share, and use the radio button group to switch between election years and observe how political preferences have changed over time.

Starting in **2005**, Copenhagen’s political identity was already leaning left - but still relatively moderate. There were, however, some noticeable exceptions. The *Tårnby* constituency stood out with only 44% of votes going to left-wing parties, placing it in right-wing territory. Meanwhile, districts like *Slots* and *Falkoner* hovered near the center with 52% and 53% left-wing support, respectively. On the other end of the spectrum, *Nørrebro* and *Vesterbro* stood as strongholds of the left bloc, each holding 71% of the vote for left-wing parties.

By **2007**, not much had changed. The city’s political map held steady, and the national government remained right-wing as in 2005. But things started taking a turn in 2011.

In the **2011** election, left-wing parties won nationally, bringing Denmark its first female Prime Minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt (*Source: [danmarkshistorien.dk – Folketingsvalget 2011](https://danmarkshistorien.lex.dk/Folketingsvalget_2011)*). The political shift was most pronounced in Copenhagen’s central districts. Left-wing support increased to 79% in *Nørrebro* and 74% in *Vesterbro*. Even neighboring *Bispebjerg* increased to 70%, from 65% in 2007. Further out, *Falkoner* and *Slots* also moved leftward, reaching 59% and 57%. *Tårnby*, however, remained the lone holdout, still leaning right with only 47% support for the left.

The left-wing trend continued in **2015**, though nationally, the tide turned again, with a right-wing Parliament. Still, Copenhagen kept drifting left. *Nørrebro* hit 81% in left-wing support — its highest yet — while *Vesterbro* remained steady at 74%. 

In **2019**, the city completed its leftward journey. *Tårnby*, long the only right-leaning district in the capital, shifted to the left — making every Copenhagen constituency part of the left-wing bloc.

  <!-- Text section -->
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    <p>
      This change can partly be attributed to a new central theme in the election: <em>climate change</em>, which made left-wing parties more appealing to climate-concerned voters 
      (<em>Source: <a href="https://danmarkshistorien.lex.dk/Folketingsvalget_2019" target="_blank">danmarkshistorien.dk – Folketingsvalget 2019</a></em>).
      Right-wing parties struggled to respond to this shift. In fact, the former leader of <em>Dansk Folkeparti</em>, Pia Kjærsgaard, famously mocked the climate movement by calling the left-wing activists 
      <em>klimatosser</em> — roughly translated to <em>climate nuts</em> in English. This caused massive criticism and outrage, and she later had to apologize for her statements. The term <em>klimatosse</em> became a symbol of the right-wing’s struggle to connect with the climate movement (<em>Source: <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klimatosse" target="_blank">Wikipedia – Klimatosse</a></em>).

Then came **2022** - a more nuanced election year. While all constituencies remained left-leaning, the deep red of 2019 began to fade slightly, especially in central neighborhoods. The reason? A push toward the political middle. The newly formed party *Moderaterne* entered Parliament for the first time and joined a historic coalition government alongside *Socialdemokratiet* and *Venstre*. The idea of a broad, centrist SVM government captured attention - and it is shown on the map, with central districts like *Indre By* and *Østerbro* becoming more balaned between left and right (*Source: [danmarkshistorien.dk - Folketingsvalget 2022](https://danmarkshistorien.lex.dk/Folketingsvalget_2022)*).

From 2005 to 2022, Copenhagen has shifted decisively to the left. While *Nørrebro*, *Vesterbro*, and *Bispebjerg* have consistently shown strong left-wing dominance, other neighborhoods like *Tårnby*, *Falkoner*, and *Slots* have followed a more balanced path — often hovering between 45% and 63% support for left-wing parties, yet still trending gradually leftward over time. This raises a crucial question: what drives these differences? Why are some neighborhoods shifting more than others? Are political parties reshaping their political agenda in ways that sway voter behavior? Or is the shift rooted in the changing population itself — with each district home to different kinds of people whose backgrounds, values, and lifestyles shape their political leanings? Are we even looking at the same residents in 2022 as in 2005? Or is it, perhaps, a combination of both political change and demographic transformation?

In the next section, we explore how each party harvest their votes across Copenhagen’s districts — and later, in the [Sociodemographics](/demographics) page, we turn our attention to the people themselves: who lives where, and how might that shape the political map?

## Winners, Losers, and Loyalists: Party Shifts Across Copenhagen

We have explored the share of left-wing and right-wing voters in Copenhagen over the years. Now, let’s take a closer look at individual parties and how they have performed across the city’s constituencies.

We focus on the most popular parties — though these naturally vary over time and across constituencies. To ensure fair comparison, for each election year we identify the top five parties based on vote share across all constituencies. Altogether, this gives us a total of ten key parties to analyze.

The figure below presents an interactive bar chart showing how these ten parties have performed in Copenhagen over time.

When examining the central districts *Indre By* and *Østerbro*, we see similar patterns: parties like *Radikale Venstre*, *Socialdemokratiet*, and *Venstre* have traditionally achieved strong support. Since 2011, *Enhedslisten* has also started gaining ground in both areas and became the most popular party in *Indre By* by 2022. Overall, these two districts appear politically aligned and lean toward a more social-liberal profile compared to the rest of the city center. In contrast, the picture changes in the two other central districts, *Vesterbro* and *Nørrebro*. Since 2011, *Enhedslisten* has dominated both districts. In *Nørrebro* in particular, the party secured 28.7% of the vote in 2019, marking it as a stronghold. *Socialdemokratiet* and *Venstre* are notably less popular in these areas. While *Bispebjerg* is also a stronghold for *Enhedslisten*, it shows a more dynamic political evolution. *Socialdemokratiet* was clearly dominant in 2005 and 2007, but *Enhedslisten* began rising steadily from 2011 onward. Since 2011, the votes in *Bispebjerg* has shown these two parties as the largest, reflecting an ongoing political tug-of-war between traditional center-left voters and a more left-oriented climate-focused party like *Enhedslisten*.

In the suburban districts — *Brønshøj*, *Valby*, *Sundbyvester*, and *Sundbyøster* — *Socialdemokratiet* maintains a stronghold. However, another notable trend emerges: the rise (and fall) of *Dansk Folkeparti*. In 2015, the party received around 14% of the vote in these areas, riding a national wave of focus on asylum and immigration policy. Their anti-immigration stance resonated with many voters. But their popularity sharply declined in the following years. By 2022, they were on the brink of losing parliamentary representation altogether (*Source: [www.ft.dk - Folketingsvalg 2022](https://www.ft.dk/da/aktuelt/nyheder/2022/11/valgresultat-2022)*) securing only 2.6% nationally. This sharp decline was not only due to diminished public concern over immigration, but also because other parties adopted more restrictive immigration policies themselves, for example *Socialdemokratiet*. Additionally, new far - right parties emerged — *Nye Borgerlige* in 2015 and *Stram Kurs* in 2017 — offering even harder-line alternatives. This fractured the right-wing vote and undercut *Dansk Folkeparti*'s position in the political landscape. *Tårnby* is a clear example of this shift. In 2015, *Dansk Folkeparti* nearly topped the vote here with 27%, but by 2019, their support had dropped to just 11%. Much of that lost support appears to have shifted to *Venstre*, as well as to *Nye Borgerlige*, which received 2.9% of the vote, and *Stram Kurs*, which received 2.1% in *Tårnby* (*Source: [danmarkshistorien.dk - Folketingsvalget 2015](https://danmarkshistorien.lex.dk/Folketingsvalget_2015)*), (*Source: [danmarkshistorien.dk Folketingsvalget 2011](https://danmarkshistorien.lex.dk/Folketingsvalget_2019)*).  

Finally, looking at *Slots* and *Falkoner*, we see yet another unique pattern. *Det Konservative Folkeparti* performs particularly well in these districts, alongside *Radikale Venstre*, *Venstre*, and *Socialdemokratiet*. Here, the “green wave” is far less prominent, than what we saw in more central districts of the city. Instead, these constituencies reflect a more balanced political environment — where centrist and center-right parties remain highly competitive. 

In the map below, we provide a visual overview of the winning party in each constituency across the election years.

A quick look through the election years reveals Copenhagen’s evolving political landscape. While *Socialdemokratiet* has frequently been the largest party overall, its dominance has been increasingly challenged. In recent years, *Enhedslisten* has gained significant ground, especially in the central districts, reflecting a progressive shift at the heart of the city. Other areas, such as *Slots* and *Tårnby*, have leaned more toward the right, with parties like *Venstre* securing victories — for example, in 2011. Meanwhile, central neighborhoods like *Indre By* and *Østerbro* show a more socially liberal profile, at times favoring *Radikale Venstre*. This suggests a more nuanced and mixed political identity in these districts. The 2011 election is particularly noteworthy, as it marked the return of a national left-wing government after two terms of right-wing rule. In Copenhagen, however, *Socialdemokratiet* did not dominate across the board. Instead, its coalition partners — *Radikale Venstre* and *Enhedslisten* — won several key central constituencies. This highlights the importance of allied parties in securing a majority for *Socialdemokratiet* in the city. Overall, while *Socialdemokratiet* maintains a strong base in the suburbs, it is not the leading party in the central districts, where more progressive, clima-concerned parties are gaining more support.

With all the figures and maps we have seen so far, there are many interesting trends to explore. However, we want to highlight one last specific trend from the 2022 election, which might be slightly surprising. Despite facing several controversies during the COVID-19 pandemic — including the mink scandal and the deleted text messages — it is noteworthy that *Socialdemokratiet* managed to maintain a strong share of the vote in 2022. After the *Mink Commission* released its report, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was pressured to call an early election, with *Radikale Venstre* urging the government to dissolve Parliament
(*Source: [danmarkshistorien.dk – Folketingsvalget 2022](https://danmarkshistorien.lex.dk/Folketingsvalget_2022)*). Although such circumstances might typically be expected to weaken a party’s position, *Socialdemokratiet* instead gained increased support across all constituencies and won in more districts compared to the previous election year. This suggests a base of loyal support in Copenhagen suburban districts. The timing of the election may also have played a role. With Europe facing uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine and an escalating energy crisis, *Socialdemokratiet* positioned itself as a stable and unifying force — a party capable of governing in times of crisis — which may have appealed to voters
(*Source: [TV2 Nyheder](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/politik/2022-10-05-derfor-gaar-mette-frederiksen-til-valg-paa-en-regering-henover-midten)*).
